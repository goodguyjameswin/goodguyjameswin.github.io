<li>To make changes, create a new branch based on <code>master</code> (do not create one from <code>gh-pages</code> unless strictly necessary) and make them there, then create a Pull Request to master.<br><code>gh-pages</code> is different from master in that it contains sharing features, analytics and other things that have no direct bearing with the game. <code>master</code> is the “pure” version of the game.</li>
<li>If you want to modify the CSS, please edit the SCSS files present in <code>style/</code>: <code>main.scss</code> and others. Don’t edit the <code>main.css</code>, because it’s supposed to be generated.<br>In order to compile your SCSS modifications, you need to use the <code>sass</code> gem (install it by running <code>gem install sass</code> once Ruby is installed).<br>To run SASS, simply use the following command:<br><code>sass --unix-newlines --watch style/main.scss</code><br>SASS will automatically recompile your css when changed.</li>
<li><code>Rakefile</code> contains some tasks that help during development. Feel free to add useful tasks if needed.</li>
<li>Please use 2-space indentation when editing the JavaScript. A <code>.jshintrc</code> file is present, which will help your code to follow the guidelines if you install and run <code>jshint</code>.</li>
<li>Please test your modification thoroughly before submitting your Pull Request.</li>
